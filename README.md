I write code and fiction.

I'm experienced in civic tech and moving data from one place to a new place. I'm currently doing data engineering and devops work for Justice Innovation Lab, whose mission is to reform our broken criminal justice system.

I'm also a former bookseller. I created Bookhead, where I'm on a mission to help book-ish people use technology to promote literature. See: https://www.bookhead.net/
